      Animating elements can be a big help, I published <a style="color: blue;" href="https://support.glitch.com/t/css-animations-parts-1-3-navigation">These Tutorials</a> 
      on a forums website that teaches you how to make CSS animations from scratch. <br /><br />Another powerful tool is the ability to animate things on scroll. The <a style="color: blue;" href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">AOS Library</a> is a simple tool allowing you to do just that!
    

    Wanting more? Feeling... <b id="gsapscrollup">ambitious</b>? Try <a href="https://gsap.com/" style="color: blue;">GSAP</a>. It is a tool that allows you to animate tons and tons of things. It is 
    to complicated for me, so I do not use it, but it is a wonderful tool I will be learning to use soon. 
    <br /><br/>
    Fonts are a great way to set your website apart. <a style="color: blue;" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> is a super easy way to freely get access to hundreds (actually, probably thousands) of fonts
    and even simple symbols. It just links the font into your website, so no download or account neccisary!
    
    <br /><br />
    Looking for colors? <a href="https://coolors.co/" style="color: blue;">Coolors</a> is a great tool to finding colors and making color pallates
    <br /><br />

      Inspiration
    </h1>
    One website that has great animations and modernizim is a developer named <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.samcheng.co/">Samalander's</a> website.
    <br /><br/>
    As I mentioned above, GSAP is an animation tool. Well, the developers of there website used that tool to the max. There website is wonderfully animated and well done.
    If you are wanting to animate things, this website is great inspiration.
    <br /><br />
    <b>I know</b> that was all about animations, because that is what will your set your website apart out the most.
