# Tips & Tricks

* For fonts, use something modern like Inter (a bit over-used) or Geist Sans on the body and *optionally* a different font for headers. I like Instrument Serif for headers.
* For websites that don't require much content, using putting everything in the center (NOT text-align:center, but max-width:700px;margin:3em auto;). It looks pretty nice!
* Don't just use pure white or black backgrounds. I would recommend using the colors [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F4c_l-DXsAIIcOW?format=png&name=small) for light mode backgrounds.
* Don't animate too much. Only animate some stuff and make it smooth
* Don't add too much stuff. Don't make it look overcrowded
* Font size for body text should be around 14-16px with about ~24px or line height
* Don't make the body text pure black. Fade it ONLY A BIT, not too much.
* For the colors, what I do is I start by choosing a primary color (e.g. black - only sometimes -, blue, green, purple - a bit overused because of AI, just don't use orange or red, it doesn't look as good in my opinion) and then make variants that I use for my website.
* Look at awwwards for inspiration, but sometimes the stuff on there is way to complicated to try and reproduce.
* Practice a lot. You don't learn design in 3 months. You progressively get better over multiple years until you're pretty good.
* Don't use very popular UI component libraries like Bootstrap - your website won't stand out.
* Don't overuse popular design trends. Make it look simple.
* Look for tips to make your text as readable as possible
* Don't use too much transitions or effects if you don't need them. When switching pages, do something smooth like opacity + go up). I personally don't like much transitions on scroll, unless you really need them.
* Figma is great for testing out your designs and how they look. 
* Framer is great for quickly designing websites that look really good. Check Framer University for some amazing resources.
* Check the other guides for more useful tips
