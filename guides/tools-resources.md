Animating elements can be a big help, so MilesWK from the NoMoreUglyWebsites team published <a style="color: blue;" href="https://support.glitch.com/t/css-animations-parts-1-3-navigation">these tutorials</a> that teach you how to make CSS animations from scratch.

Another powerful tool is the ability to animate things on scroll. The <a style="color: blue;" href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">AOS Library</a> is a simple tool allowing you to do just that, but if you really want to get super fancy I would recommend checking out Framer.

**Note:** GSAP might be a bit difficult for begginners

Fonts are a great way to set your website apart. <a style="color: blue;" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> is a super easy way to freely get access to hundreds (actually, probably thousands) of fonts and even simple symbols. It just links the font into your website, so no download or account needed! I would recommend Inter for the body and a nice serif font for headers
    
Looking for colors? <a href="https://coolors.co/" style="color: blue;">Coolors</a> is a great tool to finding colors and making color palettes.

## Inspiration
* One website that has great animations and modernizim is a developer named <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.samcheng.co/">Samalander's</a> website -- it is wonderfully animated and well done. If you are wanting to animate things, it's a great inspiration.

* I also appreciate [Oğuz Yağız](https://oguzyagiz.com/)'s website. It's simple yet effective.

If you want some stuff that's more radical, check out awwwards. They have some pretty cool websites features.
